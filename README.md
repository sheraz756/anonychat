# Chat Application

A simple chatting application which allows you to create public chatting rooms and invite anyone to join in on the conversation. Try the chat application by going to [this](https://hjjinx.github.io/chatting-app-react/) link

Uses the following tech stack:

- Front-end (React.js):
  - [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
  - [Socket.io client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client)
  - [react-chat-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chat-ui)
- Server (Node.js):
  - [HTTP](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
  - [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

The server is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance (using Ubuntu 20.04)

Used [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) for easily making the React app live on GitHub Pages.
